# Surveillance on Grandma

**Assignment 3**

## Project Intention
Myself and my parents recently installed a RING to watchover my grandma who lives in Florida. 
Our primary intention was to know what's going at her home when we aren't there since we live in New York. 
Grandma Ivy is 82.
After a few days of observation, my parents were really enjoying the type of activities she was up to: gardening, unboxing the chewy deliveries for her two big Main Coon cats.
We were most of all really suprised at how busy she was! The number of deliveries, visitors, the household is really busy.
I was toying with using some sort of surveillance dataset, but when it came to possibly pursuing my grandma's dataset, it felt a bit invasive.
I had the inkling thoguht that it could be really interest to purse through, and after taling with Golan, using my grandma's dataset is quite "wholesome".
I quite agree. So I set off to make a dataset that documented the surveillance my grandmother.

*I feel that I should emphasize that my grandma doesn't know about this project. If I get it to a really great place, I'd like to eventually show her.*
*However, both my parent's are well aware of the project, and suprisingly encouraged it.*

## Challenges
I encountered a lot of challenges with the dataset. The most being that because it's a dataset, I truly care about, I don't want to screw it up, which is why I'll be refining it profusely.

### Ring Videos - Full HD Resolution

[Insert Video Here]

First challenge I encountered was that I wasn't working with a stationary dataset, I had to observe my grandma frame by frame.
The very first time I attempted to extract the videos frame by frame, I had maximized the storage on my computer! 
Why? I forgot to scale the resolution and I exporated every 30 fps :)
But that's trial and error!


### Ring Videos - Scale & Crop
I realized I had to start from scratch. Deleted all the ring footage and individual videos





write** a few sentences about your dataset. What did you collect? Why did this data intrigue you? How did you collect it? What challenges did you overcome to collect/organize/use it?
